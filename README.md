# Hedera-Examples

Hedera is a public distributed ledger for building and deploying decentralized applications and microservices. You can use Hedera’s network services– Consensus, Tokens, Smart Contracts, and File Service–atop the hashgraph consensus algorithm, to build applications with high throughput, fair ordering, and low-latency consensus finality in seconds without relying on centralized infrastructure.
The network is made up of permissioned nodes run by the Hedera Governing Council, a group of term-limited enterprises that lead the network's direction. Over time the network will move to a permissionless model.
